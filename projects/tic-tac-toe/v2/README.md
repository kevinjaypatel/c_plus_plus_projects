## Program Description 

This program is the second version of the iterative c++ tic tac toe board game I am working on. In this program, I have implemented the following changes and use cases: 

* Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation for initializing the tic-tac-toe board 
* Validating slots the player selects within the cells. The user can no longer select a location that has already been marked, and cannot select a slot that is not within range of the board (i.e. 1 - 9)
* C++ reference variables are used in the algorithm for updating a players turn
