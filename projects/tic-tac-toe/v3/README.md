## Program Description 

This program is the third version of the iterative c++ tic tac toe board game. 
In this program, we have implemented the following changes and use cases: 

* Users can assign themselves user names. To achieve this we use dynamic memory that is 
sustained throughout the program until the game ends. 
* Renamed updatePlayerTurn() function to updateMove() to more precisely describe the function 
name for what the function is doing. 

## Bug fixes
* The first player now gets recognized for winning. Initially the program was missing the 
condition in which the first player won. 


## Upcoming Features / Use Cases 
* Use C++ object oriented programming for classifying in-game objects. 
* Validate user input for the marker.
